# Web Developer Assessment – Zero Eight

**Fair warning:** We're looking for quality work here. If complex layouts aren't your thing yet, maybe pass on this one – but if you're up for it, let's see what you've got.

## Objective
Implement the provided Figma design as a fully responsive layout.

## Instructions
- Complete the HTML file and link the necessary styles
- Submit your work as a .zip file named `candidate-name.zip` to pablo@zeroeight.us
- Email subject: "Zero Eight – Web Developer Job Opening"

## About using AI
**Use ChatGPT/AI as much as you want** – seriously, go wild. Just remember: if you blindly copy-paste everything it gives you, you'll probably miss the details that actually matter to us. We care about **attention to detail** and **clean, semantic code**.

If you get the design and know your way around CSS, you'll nail this. AI just won't catch every little thing we're looking for.

## Project context
You've got a .fig file in the project root. Pop it open in Figma to see what needs building. Usually you'd get desktop, tablet, and mobile designs, but this time we only have desktop.

**What happened?** The mobile and tablet versions vanished. Classic. In the real world you'd ping the designer, but here you get to figure out the responsive behavior yourself. 

**Typography hints:**
- Desktop: 1.25 scale with 16px base
- Mobile: Try a 1.19 scale to keep things readable

## Tech stuff
- Vanilla HTML and CSS (or throw in Tailwind/BEM if that's your jam)
- Only needs to work in Chromium browsers

## What we're looking for

### Good stuff
- **Smart setup**: CSS variables for colors and typography that make sense
- **Fluid typography**: Responsive text that scales nicely with those ratios
- **Proper HTML**: Semantic structure that actually means something (hint: really look at that content)
- **Clean code**: Organized classes and maintainable styles
- **Smart decisions**: How you handle those missing breakpoints

### Not so good
- Copy-paste without thinking it through
- Missing the design details
- Messy, non-semantic code
- Broken responsive behavior
- Ignoring what the content structure is actually trying to tell you

## What to expect
Most things are pretty clear in the design, but if something's ambiguous, just make a reasonable call. We might chat about your choices later.

**Heads up:** The way the content is structured in the design isn't random – your HTML should reflect that.

**Time:** Should take around 30-40 minutes.
**Feedback:** Within 72 hours.
