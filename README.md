# Web Developer Assessment – Zero Eight  

## Objective  
Implement the provided Figma design as a responsive layout.  

## Instructions  
1. Complete the HTML file and link the necessary styles.  
2. Submit your work as a `.zip` file named **candidate-name.zip** to [pablo@zeroeight.us](mailto:pablo@zeroeight.us).  
3. Use the subject line: **Zero Eight – Web Developer Job Opening**.  

## What We Evaluate  
- **HTML semantics** – Proper structure and meaningful elements.  
- **Class usage** – Clean, organized, and maintainable.  
- **UX decisions** – How you handle missing breakpoints.  

## Context  
This exercise has **no strict time limit**, but it shouldn’t take more than **20 minutes** to complete. We’re looking for **precision in execution and good decision-making**—focus on a well-structured and scalable implementation. Once submitted, we aim to review your work within **72 hours**.  

You received a **`.fig` file in the project root** containing the design. Open it in **Figma** to view what you need to implement. Normally, you’d get desktop, tablet, and mobile versions, but this time only desktop is available.  

### Why?  
Well… the mobile and tablet versions got lost. It happens. If this were a real project, you'd probably reach out to the designer—but in this case, you’ll need to **implement a fully responsive version** without those additional viewports. The project notes suggest that a **1.19 typography scale** works well for mobile, so that might be a good starting point.  

## Tech Guidelines  
- Use **vanilla HTML and CSS**.  
- You may use **any CSS framework** (e.g., Tailwind) or structure styles with **BEM** if you prefer.  
- The implementation only needs to be **usable in Chromium-based browsers**. No testing will be done outside of this.  

We’ve **blurred out other sections** in the design file to keep the focus on what you need to implement. Stick to what’s provided—extra sections or structures won’t be considered.  

## Important Note  
This is **not production code**, so aspects like performance optimizations aren’t a focus here. That said, a clean structure, good accessibility considerations, and proper handling of styles are definitely valued.  

Some aspects of the implementation allow for interpretation (not many, really), but if something isn’t specified, make a reasonable decision. We may discuss your approach in a review.  

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
